# Here's the logical flow of the complete IAM module:

1. **Input Processing**

```hcl
Variables → Data Sources → Local Variables
- Variables collect user inputs (users, groups, environment)
- Data sources check existing resources
- Locals prepare filtered lists and naming conventions
```

2. **Policy Configuration**

```hcl
Password Policy Configuration
- Sets security requirements
- Password complexity rules
- Rotation requirements
```

3. **Group Management:**

```hcl
Admin Group → Developer Group
- Checks for existing groups
- Creates new groups if needed
- Attaches appropriate policies
  ├─ Admin: Full access
  └─ Developer: Limited read access
```

4. **User Management:**

```hcl
Filter Users → Create Users → Assign Groups
- Removes existing users
- Creates new users with naming convention
- Associates users with appropriate groups
```

5. **Access Setup:**

```hcl
Generate Access Keys
- Admin keys
- Developer keys
- Initial access credentials
```

6. **Output Generation:**

```hcl
Resource Information → Access Credentials
- Group names
- Created user lists
- Access keys (sensitive)
- Separate admin/developer credentials
```

7. **State Dependencies:**

```hcl
Data Sources → Groups → Users → Memberships → Access Keys
```

This creates a complete IAM setup with secure access management and follows AWS best practices for user management.

# **Here's a breakdown of each block in the IAM Groups Module:**

```jsx
# 1. Data Blocks
data "aws_iam_group", data "aws_iam_user"
Purpose: Fetch existing resources
Usage: Prevents duplicates, enables resource reuse

# 2. Variables Block
variable "*"
Key Variables:
- admin_users/developer_users: User lists
- environment/project: Resource naming
- use_existing_*_group: Control flags
- group_names: Existing group references

# 3. Locals Block
locals { ... }
Functions:
- Generates standardized names
- Filters existing users
- Prepares user lists

# 4. Password Policy
aws_iam_account_password_policy
Sets security standards:
- Minimum length: 12
- Character requirements
- Rotation: 90 days
- Reuse prevention: 24 passwords

# 5. Group Resources
aws_iam_group, aws_iam_group_policy_attachment
Creates/manages:
- Admin group with full access
- Developer group with read access
- Policy attachments

# 6. User Resources
aws_iam_user, aws_iam_user_group_membership
Handles:
- User creation with prefixes
- Group membership assignment
- Separate admin/dev users

# 7. Access Keys
aws_iam_access_key
Manages:
- Initial access credentials
- Separate admin/dev keys
- Secure key generation

# 8. Outputs
output "*"
Provides:
- Group names
- Created user lists
- Access credentials (sensitive)
- Separate admin/dev credentials

# 9. Dependencies:
Data Sources → Groups → Users → Memberships → Access Keys → Outputs
```
